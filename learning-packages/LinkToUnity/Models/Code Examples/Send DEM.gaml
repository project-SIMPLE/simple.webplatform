/**
* Name: SendDEM
* Show how to send a grid/matrix to Unity and modify it on the fly. It works with the Scene "Assets/Scenes/Code Example/Receive DEM Data" from the Unity Template.
* In this model, a DEM is loaded from GAMA as soon as a player logs on. The player, who is in the centre of a crater at the start of the game, can then move around 
* this DEM and catch/throw a ball whose physics are managed by Unity. From GAMA, you can dynamically increase the height of a cell by pressing 'R'. 
* The cell whose height is increased will be the one where the mouse is located. Similarly, you can decrease the height of a cell by pressing 'T'. 
* The player in the VR headset will automatically see the DEM changed in the game.
