/**
* Name: SendDEM
* Show how to send water data to Unity and modify it on the fly. It works with the Scene "Assets/Scenes/Code Example/Receive Water Data" from the Unity Template.
* The model simulates a flood in a river and sent to Unity the water area with water material. In addition, a DEM is used a background.
